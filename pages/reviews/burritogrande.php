            <h3>Burrito Grande</h3>

            <p>
                I opened the carton up and the burrito did not look very appetizing.
                I order a sauce and they put the sauce over the burrito and it just
                dripped on the side. I am sure it will make the burrito very soggy
                later on. I took my first and the first thing that I realized was
                that the food was cold. I order a pork burrito and I have to say it
                was pretty tasty, but again cold! The pork itself was sweet and good
                tasting. The pico de gallo was simply a mixture of tomatoes and onions
                and thatâ€™s all it tasted like. I order fried beens, pork, rice, and
                the proportion of these in my burrito was way off. Way to much fried
                beans and barely any rice, it did have a nice amount of pork in it.
                At the end, my last few bites, all that was left was extra unused tortilla,
                which I did not eat because it was too soggy with the sauce. Another thing
                I liked was that they were not kidding when they burrito grande, which
                for those that do not know Spanish that means big burrito. So yes,
                it is big, and I am very full.
